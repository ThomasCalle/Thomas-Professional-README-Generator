## Description:
Creating an open source project on GitHub is important, so it is even more important to have a professional README.md file as it will ensure; clients, colleagues and employers understand the fundamental use and purpose of your application. The sole purpose of my project was to offer the GitHub community a solid application that would create ease by quickly generating a README.md file when using the command-line. Thus, allowing users among the GitHub community to save valuable time among their projects. Thereby, allowing them to optimize focus and efficency onto other priorities in order to achieve their goals.

# Overview
## The Challenge:
Create an effective command-line runned application that in-takes a users input inorder to dynamically generate a professional README.md file that will have a clean, minimal and visually appealing format.

## User Story
```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional 
README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Installation Process:

## Built With
- Saiyan Pride
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Inquirer.js: [Version 8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
- License Badge: [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)
- Visual Studio Code: [Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Professional Guide: [README.md](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## What I Learned
- Create an non-deployed application that invokes a “node index.js” command.

- Communication skills: created a visually understanding walkthrough  video demonstrating functionality based on BootCamp Video Submission Guidelines (and of course my own special touch).

- Organization: ensure the necessary folder documentation by creating “.gitignore” file to include: node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so the node_modules directory isn't tracked/uploaded to GitHub.

### Continued Development:
1. Add Network and Social Media Badges.
2. Contniue creating more viable and effective functionality.
3. Add more generated sections such as: user story, acceptance criteria.
4. Create Accesability needs features: described audio/visual etc.
